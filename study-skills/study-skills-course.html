<h2><font color="navy"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></b></font></p>
 <p class="body" left="" align="">
Before you book a place at one of our Study Skills Courses, here are the answers to some commonly-asked questions.
<br><br>
<b>1. How is the Study Skills Course structured?</b></font>
<br><br>
The Study Skills Course comprises numerous short sessions of 30 to 50 minutes, each introducing one or several key study strategies or techniques, with frequent short breaks in between to help students remain attentive and focused. The strategies and techniques introduced in the sessions build one on another through the course of the day. Continual review and reinforcement in a fun, engaging, non-threatening way is used to check learning and ensure retention of the key ideas covered.<br><br>
<b>2. Are you really able to keep students fully engaged for a whole day?</b></font>
<br><br>
Absolutely. In fact, at the end of the day many students not only remark how valuable the course was but also how the day seemed to fly by. And it does, in part because of the way in which the course is structured but also because students are introduced to new and highly effective ways to learn in a fun, relaxed and humorous fashion.
<br><br>
<b>3. Is this course suitable for high school students of all ages?</b></font>
<br><br>
In a word, yes. This Study Skills Course is designed to help high school students study more effectively and improve their grades regardless of their age. It is especially beneficial for students in years 10 to 12 preparing for the VCE, HSC or QCST. 
<br><br>
That said, the earlier students are exposed to effective study techniques the sooner they can benefit from them. Which is why this course is designed to equip students with key, lifelong learning skills and is delivered in a fun and easy-to-follow way so that students from years 7, 8 and 9 can benefit from the workshop just as much as students in years 10 to 12. 
<br><br>
<b>4. What materials do students receive at the course?</b></font>
<br><br>
Students receive a colour A4 Study Skills binder which builds up through the course of the day with handouts inserted summarising the key ideas and techniques as they are discussed and activities undertaken. The binder is divided in to key sections reflecting the main techniques covered during the day and serves as an important and easy to use review and reference document after the course.
<br><br>
<b>5. What is the Online Follow-up Program?</b></font>
<br><br>
Some students find it helpful to have a structured, step-by-step way to review and apply what they learn after the course. The Online Follow-up Program provides this. It consists of access to a special web page each day for seven days and gets students to actively review and use what they learned at the workshop at no extra charge, a valuable bonus. 
<br><br>
<b>6. Do you run this Study Skills Course for schools?</b><br><br>
Yes. Have this course delivered at your school at a time of your choice anywhere in Australia or New Zealand. For more information on running this course in your school including the cost please visit the <a href="Study-Skills.html">In School Study Skills Course</a> web page.<br><br>
<b>7. My son or daughter would benefit from learning these study skills but is unable or would prefer not to attend a public course. Any other options?</b>
<br><br>
Yes. If the above dates aren't convenient or your son or daughter learns better one one one then a Personal Coaching Program may be a better option. We cover the exact same ideas and techniques as in this workshop and can take place any time during the year. For more details please visit <a href="http://www.gloo.com.au/HSC-Study-Skills-Programs-Sydney.html">Study Skills Personal Coaching Programs</a>.<br><br>
If your son or daughter has friends who would also benefit from this course then another option is to ask your school to run the In School version of this workshop. For more details about this option visit <a href="http://www.gloo.com.au/Study-Skills.html">In School Study Skills Course</a>.</p>
