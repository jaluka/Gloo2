<h2><font color="navy"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></b></font></p>
 <p class="body" left="" align="">
Before you register your interest in a Gloo Study Skills Course at your school, here are the answers to some commonly-asked questions.
<br><br>
<b>1. How is the Study Skills Course structured?</b></font>
<br><br>
The Study Skills Course comprises numerous short sessions of 30 to 50 minutes, each introducing one or several key study strategies or techniques, with frequent short breaks in between to help students remain attentive and focused. The strategies and techniques introduced in the sessions build one on another through the course of the day. Continual review and reinforcement in a fun, engaging, non-threatening way is used to check learning and ensure retention of the key ideas covered.<br><br>
<b>2. Are you really able to keep students fully engaged for a whole day?</b></font>
<br><br>
Absolutely. In fact, many students not only remark how valuable the course was but also how the day seemed to fly by. And it does, in part because of the way in which the course is structured but also because students are introduced to new and highly effective ways to learn in a fun, relaxed and humorous fashion.
<br><br>
<b>3. Is this course suitable for high school students of all ages?</b></font>
<br><br>
In a word, yes. This Study Skills Course is designed to help high school students study more effectively and improve their grades regardless of their age. It is especially beneficial for students in years 10 to 12 preparing for the VCE, HSC or QCST. 
<br><br>
That said, the earlier students are exposed to effective study techniques the sooner they can benefit from them. Which is why this course is designed to equip students with key, lifelong learning skills and is delivered in a fun and easy-to-follow way so that students from years 7, 8 and 9 can benefit from the workshop just as much as students in years 10 to 12. 
<br><br>
<b>4. What type of room and equipment do you need to run the course?</b></font>
<br><br>
We simply need a suitably sized room for the group size arranged in table of 4 or 6 students each plus access to a data projector and screen. Students are asked to bring with them a text book, either fiction or non-fiction, for use in the reading exercises. All other course materials will be provided.
<br><br>
<b>5. What materials do students receive at the course?</b></font>
<br><br>
Students receive a colour A4 Study Skills binder which builds up through the course of the day with handouts inserted summarising the key ideas and techniques as they are discussed and activities undertaken. The binder is divided in to key sections reflecting the main techniques covered during the day and serves as an important and easy to use review and reference document after the course.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is the Online Follow-up Program?</b></font>
<br><br>
Some students find it helpful to have a structured, step-by-step way to review and apply what they learn after the course. The Online Follow-up Program provides this. It consists of access to a special web page each day for seven days and gets students to actively review and use what they learned at the workshop. 
<br><br>
<b>7. My school has a limited budget, is it possible to reduce the cost at all?</b></font>
<br><br>
Yes. Firstly, if you are happy for students not to receive the course binder and are also able to have the course handouts photocopied (c20 handouts per student) then you can eliminate the $4 per student materials fee.<br><br>
Secondly, you can also consider running the shorter, half day version of this Study Skills Course. If you are interested in this option please contact us for details by completing the form below.
<br><br>
Finally, from time to time we run Specials to encourage schools to book this valuable Study Skills Course in advance. For courses booked by 15 May 2015 for delivery any time in 2015 there is a Special running at present which reduces the Delivery Fee to just $1,000 plus GST, half the usual cost.
<br><br>
<b>8. We're a school but looking for something slightly different, can you help us?</B></font><br><br>
Yes. Once we understand what you are looking to achieve, we can tailor something suitable to meet your needs, budget and timeframe. Please contact us using the form and let us know what you are looking to achieve.<br><br>
<b>9. I'm a parent reading this, do you run this as a Public Course?</b></font>
<br><br>
Yes. We also run this as a Public Course, open to all students, in cities around Australia during the school holidays. Our next Study Skills Public Courses are taking place shortly in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra <a href="http://www.gloo.com.au/study-skills-course-sydney.html">Study Skills For High School Students 1 Day Public Course</a>.<br><br>
Plus we also cover the same ideas and techniques for students who prefer to learn on a one to one basis through our <a href="http://www.gloo.com.au/HSC-Study-Skills-Programs-Sydney.html">Study Skills Personal Coaching Programs</a>.</p>
