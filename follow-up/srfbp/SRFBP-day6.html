Today's Activities</font></h2>
<p class="body" align="left">
<b>You are coming toward the end of this short program</b> and today's activities will continue to pull everything together for you by focusing on your reading speed, comprehension, approach and note-taking.
</p>

Memorable Notes<br>
- Using XMind
<b></b></font></h2>
<p class="body" align="left">
As you saw at the workshop, Mapping on the computer is a fast and flexible way to make notes on the material you read. It's also a great planning tool with many different uses. So if you haven't already done so download a copy of the free version of XMind from the following website
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.xmind.net">http://www.xmind.net</a>
<br><br>
<b>Spend a few minutes now to familiarise yourself with the basics of the software,</b> in particular how to create a new map, add branches and then organise them. It's all fairly simple and straightforward. You will use the software shortly to make notes on what you read. 
</p>
<h2><font color=navy>
Remembering What You Read<br>
- Applying The 3 Step Reading Approach
</font></h2>
<p class="body" align="left">
Now we'll apply the approach. Grab your book or reading material. Select a reasonable chunk of information to read, perhaps one chapter or 10 to 20 pages.<br><br>
<b>Step 1 PREVIEW.</b> Increase your familiarity prior to reading. Quickly flick through the chapter or section you've chosen and ask yourself, what do you already know about the subject matter? Notice any headings, tables, graphs or illustrations. If there is a summary at the start or conclusion at the end quickly read it.<br><br>Before you read get some questions in your mind. Why are you reading this information? What are you going to do with this information? What facts or figures are you looking for? How will you use them? These simple questions will activate your mind to focus in on and recognise key information when you begin reading.   
<br><br>
<b>Step 2 READ and SUMMARISE.</b> You will read the information twice. First time read at high speed as quickly as you can focusing on getting an understanding of the big picture, the key ideas, themes and concepts. When finished mentally ask yourself what were the key points? Open up a map in XMind and make some initial quick notes on what you've just read. 
<br><br>
Now re-read the section at your comfortable reading pace a slightly slower pace reinforcing the key ideas and concepts in your mind but also now focusing on important details. As you read through this second time, when you come to important information pause and add notes to your map in XMind.
<br><br>
The good news is that if you've followed the above process you will already have a written summary of the information you've just read in the form of your map. So now simply spend a moment or two to review and add to your notes. Dump down anything else that you think may be important and comes to mind, don't worry about the order. 
<br><br>
When finished, begin to organise your notes, grouping together similar items and themes. Remove any duplication. If other relevant ideas or thoughts come to mind as you organise and are focused on the key headings and themes, then simply add them in. When finished put your branches in what is the most logical order for you. You now have a set of notes summarising what you have just read so save your map.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3 REVIEW.</b> Take a minute to quickly review your completed map. Perhaps print it out. Review it again briefly the next day to help really lock the information in to your long-term memory. 
<br><br>
All done! The process takes longer to describe than actually do! And once you've done it a couple of times it will become second nature to you and you will be able to make memorable notes on anything you read quickly and easily with excellent understanding and recall.
<br><br>
<b>***</b>
<br><br>
Tomorrow is the final day of this short follow-up program and you will do a quick test of your reading speed to see how much you have improved.
<br><br>
<b>End of Day 6!</b>
