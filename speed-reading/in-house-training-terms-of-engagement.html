Terms Of Engagement And Booking Conditions
</font></h2>


<p class="body"><b>
Thank you for your interest in engaging Gloo The Memory Company to deliver training for you. </b>

Please note that a small number of conditions apply when you engage Gloo The Memory Company and these are detailed below. When you pay your Engagement Invoice you are confirming that you accept these conditions. So please take a moment to read them now, thanks.
 <p><img src="images/dotline_bk_02.gif" width="527" height="2"></p>


<p class="body"><font color="navy"><b>
Confirming Your Job</b>
</font></p>
<p class="body">
We have tentatively booked in for you the date(s) we have identified for your training and we will hold the agreed date(s) for you for the next 7 days while you arrange for your engagement invoice to be paid.
</p>
<p class="body"><font color="navy"><b>
Your Payment Terms</b>
</font></p>
<p class="body">50% of the agreed value of the job is payable upon engagement. The balance is payable 1 calendar month prior to the start of the training you have booked. Different payment terms may apply to any discounted rates or special promotions which we may run from time to time and these conditions will be advised separately.
</p>
<p class="body"><font color="navy"><b>
If You Change Or Cancel Confirmed Work</b>
</font></p>
<p class="body">
By paying your Engagement Invoice you are making a firm booking for delivery of the agreed work on the agreed date(s) and at the agreed total cost. 
<br><br>
However, if you choose to cancel a confirmed job and you do so at least 1 calendar month before the start date of the job you will not be liable for the balance of payment for the confirmed work should the workshop not go ahead. 
<br><br>
In addition, we will, at our discretion, work with you to identify a suitable alternative date to deliver the agreed work. If we are able to find a mutually convenient date the engagement fee you have paid will be transferred to the new date and treated as a credit against the cost of the job to be delivered on the new date.
<br><br>
Confirmed work cancelled within 1 calendar month of the agreed start date remains payable in full. Engagement fees once paid are not refundable except in the unlikely 
event that we are unable to deliver a confirmed job for you in which case the engagement fee will be returned to you in full.
<br><br>
<b>If you do need to cancel or change a confirmed job please email us by</b><br> <a href="mailto:changes@gloo.com.au? subject=Gloo In-House Workshop Booking - CHANGE REQUEST">clicking here</a>. <br>
<p class="body"><font color="navy"><b>
If You Make Changes To The Agreed Scope Of Work
</b>
</font></p>
<p class="body">
The cost we have quoted you for the work we have agreed to undertake is based upon our understanding of your requirements at the time of engagement and as confirmed to you via email.
<br><br>If you wish to make changes to the nature or scope of the agreed work we are happy to consider such requests. If such requests will result in additional preparation, travel or delivery time and/or costs we will advise you of these additional costs and ask you to accept them before agreeing to vary the original scope.<br>
</p>
<p class="body"><font color="navy"><b>
Delivery Of Confirmed Work
</b>
</font></p>
<p class="body">
In the unlikely event that we are unable to deliver a confirmed job for you due to illness or a change in circumstances any engagement fee you have paid will be returned to you in full.<br><br>
